# VSCode Code CSS  Extensions.

I have a few favourite extensions that I like to use listed below. I reccomend that you install them and try them out for yourself. I have included the links to the extensions but it is easier just to open up the extension tab in VSCode and install them. Each extension comes with a Readme file that will explain how to use and configure the plugin.

- [CSS Peak](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)
- [IntelliSense For CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)

There are lots of extensions for making your CSS files look pretty when you format you use the Format Document option in VSCode. I only use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) download it using the extension manager in the VSCode Editor. There are other extensions that Use the Prettier name but use the one with nearly 8 million downloads.

To get the most out of prettier check out my repo configuring Prettier with VSCode.

You can always search the Marketplace for new extensions for CSS [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=CSS&target=VSCode&category=Programming%20Languages&sortBy=Relevance)
