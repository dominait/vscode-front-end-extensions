# VSCode CSS  Extensions.

I have a few favourite extensions that I like to use listed below. I reccomend that you install them and try them out for yourself. I have included the links to the extensions but it is easier just to open up the extension tab in VSCode and install them. Each extension comes with a Readme file that will explain how to use and configure the plugin.

## Installed ##
- [CSS Peak](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)
- [IntelliSense For CSS Class Names](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)



## Built In To VSCode ##
-  Emmet isn't a plugin but a feature built into VSCode you should learn how to use it. I have a Readme that goes through the basics of how to learn Emmet. You can find out how to use Emmet CSS Abbreviations  from the  Emmet [documentaion](https://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations/)
