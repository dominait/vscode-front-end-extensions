# VSCode CSS  Extensions.

I have a few favourite extensions that I like to use listed below. I reccomend that you install them and try them out for yourself. I have included the links to the extensions but it is easier just to open up the extension tab in VSCode and install them. Each extension comes with a Readme file that will explain how to use and configure the plugin.

You can also search google for Front End Developer Extensions for VSCode, check youtube for videos where developers list there favourite VSCode Extensions.
