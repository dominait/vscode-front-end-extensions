# VSCode HTML Extensions.

I find when I am marking up content or using html to build UI then the quicker I can get that done the more I can concentrate on other tasks. I have include a list of extensions that I find useful.

- **LiveServer:** allows you to launch a local development server, there is also a version for PHP if your interested [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

- **Prettier:** is a highly customizable opinionated code formatter. This extension needs some customization to get it to work the way you want if you don't like the defaults. I have a quick tutorial on setting up Prettier with VSCode you can find it
  at [future link](https://github.com/dominait/vscode-workspaces/blob/master/javascript-extensions/Readme.md) or follow this tutorial [this tutorial](https//prettier.io) featured on medium blog site.
